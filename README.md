# PLG-julia
A julia port of the PLG software. This allows the generation of lattice structures mainly for Additive Manufacturing.

# Roadmap

1. Port over matlab methods to julia
2. Enable a plotting library.
3. Enable a input file type for composing.
4. Nodes without overlap water tight stl files.

# Initial work

Minimal working example.
Determine how to store unit cells and composing.
  * Try one will be with [yaml](https://github.com/JuliaData/YAML.jl)
